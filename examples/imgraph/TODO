* update to gtkmm1.3

* overhaul program, since this is really just a prototype

* make a text-based alternative to the gui

* box outlines should not be included in the .ps file, or they should be
  listed after everything else so they can be easily removed.

* make it possible to draw multiple functions on one graph

* add a button to interrupt current graph

* create main class for manager window, create class for plot windows
  - each plot window will call the affine program, and will call
    ghostscript on the output of that program.

* use affine info to split boxes intelligently. ie first find bounds,
  then split that parallelogram along short axis.

* Translate output to origin, to preserve full precision (but makes
  extraction of data points annoying).

* add an undo button to revert to the previous set of parameters

* add a child checkbox to "maintain aspect ratio" that resizes the
  window to fit both the aspect ratio and the given x-y domains.

* MathML and/or TeX support would be nice :)

* Enable drawing multiple functions on the same plot, with a given color
  for each.

* add an option to set the plot color.

* add a progress meter
