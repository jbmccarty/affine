If you downloaded this from version control, run ./bootstrap before
following the rest of the instructions, in order to generate the build
system.

Run the commands
  cd '=build'
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Run `./configure --help' to see the available options. There is not yet
an install target. Don't forget to export LD_LIBARY_PATH=`pwd`/libaffine
You need GCC version 3.0 or greater.
